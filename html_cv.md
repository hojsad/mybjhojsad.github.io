### Currently searching for a PhD student position

Please note that this is a *real* resume, and I’m really looking for a
PhD student position at the moment. I made this resume because Yihui
asked me if I’d like to test the **pagedown** package with my resume. If
you are interested in my background and skills, please feel free to
contact me.
